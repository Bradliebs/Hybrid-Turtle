[Deprecated] historical() relies on an API that Yahoo have removed.  We'll map this request to chart() for convenience, but, please consider using chart() directly instead; for more info see https://github.com/gadicc/yahoo-finance2/issues/795.  This will only be shown once, but you can suppress this message in future with `new YahooFinance({ suppressNotices: ['ripHistorical'] })`.

This may happen intermittently and you should catch errors appropriately.  However:  1) if this recently started happening on every request for a symbol that used to work, Yahoo may have changed their API.  2) If this happens on every request for a symbol you've never used before, but not for other symbols, you've found an edge-case (OR, we may just be protecting you from "bad" data sometimes stored for e.g. misspelt symbols on Yahoo's side).

This may happen intermittently and you should catch errors appropriately.  However:  1) if this recently started happening on every request for a symbol that used to work, Yahoo may have changed their API.  2) If this happens on every request for a symbol you've never used before, but not for other symbols, you've found an edge-case (OR, we may just be protecting you from "bad" data sometimes stored for e.g. misspelt symbols on Yahoo's side).

This may happen intermittently and you should catch errors appropriately.  However:  1) if this recently started happening on every request for a symbol that used to work, Yahoo may have changed their API.  2) If this happens on every request for a symbol you've never used before, but not for other symbols, you've found an edge-case (OR, we may just be protecting you from "bad" data sometimes stored for e.g. misspelt symbols on Yahoo's side).

Please see if anyone has reported this previously:

At the end of the doc, there's also a section on how to "Help Fix Validation Errors" in case you'd like to contribute to the project.  Most of the time, these fixes are very quick and easy; it's just hard for our small core team to keep up, so help is always appreciated!
