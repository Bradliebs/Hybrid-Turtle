## 1. First-Time Setup

**Prerequisite:** Node.js **20 LTS** or **22 LTS** (choose the LTS tab on nodejs.org).

### Step 1 — Install & Start

```bash
cd hybridturtle
npm install                   # Install dependencies
npx prisma generate           # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma db push             # Create database tables
npx prisma db seed             # Import stock universe from Planning/ CSVs
npm run dev                    # Start dashboard at http://localhost:3000
```

Or use the batch files:
- `install.bat` — Full install
- `start.bat` — Start the dashboard
- `run-dashboard.bat` — Compatibility alias that redirects to `start.bat`

### Step 2 — Configure Settings

Navigate to `/settings` and complete each section (see below).

### Step 3 — Connect Trading 212

Enter your API credentials and sync your portfolio (see Section 4).

### Step 4 — Verify Health

Check the Dashboard — the traffic light should be GREEN.

---

## 2. Settings Screen

URL: `/settings`

The Settings page has 6 sections:

### 2.1 Account & Risk Profile

| Field | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Equity (£)** | Your total account equity. Used for position sizing. Auto-updated if Trading 212 is connected. |
| **Risk Profile** | Controls risk-per-trade % and max positions. |

**Risk Profile Options:**

| Profile | Risk/Trade | Max Positions | Max Open Risk |
|---------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 0.75% | 8 | 7.0% |
| **Balanced** (default) | **0.95%** | **5** | **5.5%** |
| Small Account | 2.00% | 4 | 10.0% |
| Aggressive | 3.00% | 3 | 12.0% |

> **Note:** The AGGRESSIVE profile also uses a wider initial stop (2.0×ATR vs the default 1.5×ATR).

**Aggressive Profile Details:**

| Category | Parameter | Value |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Caps | Max Positions | 3 |
| Caps | Max Position (Core) | 40% |
| Caps | Max Position (High-Risk) | 20% |
| Caps | Max Cluster | 35% |
| Caps | Max Super-Cluster | 50% |
| Caps | Max Sector | 45% |
| Entry | ATR Buffer | Adaptive 5%–20% (Module 11b) |
| Entry | DIST_READY | ≤ 2.0% |
| Entry | DIST_WATCH | ≤ 3.0% |
| Regime | Benchmarks | SPY + VWRL (dual benchmark) |

Click **Save Settings** to persist. This updates the database via `PUT /api/settings`.

### 2.2 Trading 212 Integration

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| API Key | Your Trading 212 API key |
| API Secret | Your Trading 212 API secret |
| Environment | `Demo` or `Live` — start with Demo for testing |

- **Connect & Test** — Tests the connection. If successful, stores credentials and shows your account ID + currency.
- **Sync Now** — Imports all T212 positions into the dashboard.
- **Disconnect** — Removes stored credentials.

**ISA Account (separate section):**

If you also have a T212 ISA account, a second set of API Key / Secret fields is available. Connect and sync ISA positions independently. ISA positions sync with `accountType: ISA` so they’re tracked separately in the portfolio.

### 2.3 Market Data Provider

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| Provider | **Yahoo Finance** (default) or **EODHD** (requires API key) |
| EODHD API Key | Only needed if you select EODHD as provider |

Yahoo Finance is free and requires no API key. EODHD is optional and offered as an alternative data source.

### 2.4 Data Sources

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Alpha Vantage API Key | Optional backup data source. Get a free key at [alphavantage.co](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) |

### 2.4 Telegram Notifications

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Bot Token | Your Telegram bot token (from @BotFather) |
| Chat ID | Your Telegram chat or group ID |
| **Send Test** | Sends a test message to verify the setup |

The nightly cron sends summaries via Telegram including: health status, regime, open positions, stop updates, and alerts.

### 2.5 Ticker Universe Management

This is where you manage which stocks the system scans and monitors. See Section 3 for full details.

### 2.6 Immutable Rules

Read-only list of 10 rules the system enforces. These cannot be changed:

1. Stops NEVER go down
2. No entries without BULLISH regime
3. No entries without health GREEN/YELLOW
4. Risk per trade ≤ profile limit
5. Total open risk ≤ profile cap
6. Position sizing always rounds DOWN
7. No buying on Monday (Observation phase)
8. Anti-chasing guard on gaps
9. Super-cluster cap at 50%
10. Heartbeat must be fresh

---

## 3. Managing Your Ticker Universe

### How Stocks Get Into the System

There are 3 ways:

#### Method 1 — Settings Page (Single Ticker)

1. Go to `/settings` → scroll to **Ticker Universe**
2. Type a ticker (e.g. `NVDA`) in the input box
3. Select a sleeve: **CORE**, **ETF**, **HIGH_RISK**, or **HEDGE**
4. Click **Add**
5. The stock is created in the database via `POST /api/stocks`

#### Method 2 — Seed from Planning Files (Bulk)

The Planning folder contains your stock lists:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `stock_core_200.txt` | Core sleeve tickers |
| `etf_core.txt` | ETF sleeve tickers |
| `stock_high_risk.txt` | High-risk sleeve tickers |
| `hedge.txt` | Hedge sleeve tickers (long-term holds) |
| `ticker_map.csv` | Ticker → name/sector/cluster mappings |
| `cluster_map.csv` | Ticker → cluster assignments |
| `super_cluster_map.csv` | Ticker → super-cluster groupings |
| `region_map.csv` | Ticker → region + currency |

Run the seed to import them all:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

This bulk-upserts all stocks with full metadata (name, sector, cluster, super-cluster, region, currency).

#### Method 3 — Auto-Created from Trading 212

When you sync with Trading 212, any position ticker not already in the database is auto-created with sleeve = `CORE`.

### Removing a Stock

- Click the **X** button next to any stock in the Settings ticker table.
- This performs a soft-delete (sets `active = false`).
- The stock won't appear in scans but historical positions are preserved.
- Hard delete is only possible if the stock has zero positions.

### Searching & Filtering

Use the search box above the ticker table to filter by ticker, name, or sector. Use the sleeve tabs to filter by CORE / ETF / HIGH_RISK / HEDGE.

### Stock Data Fields

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Ticker | Manual / seed | Yahoo Finance format (e.g. `AAPL`, `GLEN.L`, `SAP.DE`) |
| Name | Seed / auto | Company name |
| Sleeve | Manual / seed | CORE, ETF, HIGH_RISK, or HEDGE |
| Sector | Seed | e.g. Technology, Healthcare |
| Cluster | Seed / `cluster_map.csv` | e.g. Mega Tech, Energy |
| Super Cluster | Seed / `super_cluster_map.csv` | e.g. MEGA_TECH_AI |
| Region | Seed / `region_map.csv` | e.g. US, UK, EU |
| Currency | Seed / `region_map.csv` | USD, GBP, GBX, EUR, etc. |

## 4. Connecting Trading 212

### Initial Connection

1. Go to `/settings` → **Trading 212 Integration**
2. Enter your **API Key** and **API Secret** from Trading 212
3. Select **Demo** or **Live** environment
4. Click **Connect & Test**
5. If successful you'll see your Account ID and Currency

### Syncing Positions

Two places to sync:
- **Settings page** → "Sync Now" button
- **Portfolio → Positions page** → "Sync Positions" button

**What sync does:**
1. Fetches all your T212 positions + account summary
2. Creates new positions in the dashboard DB (with 5% default stop-loss)
3. Updates existing positions (shares / entry price)
4. Marks positions closed on T212 as CLOSED in the dashboard
5. Updates your equity from T212 total account value
6. Updates cash, invested, unrealised P&L figures

**After sync:** The Positions page shows a results card with counts: X new, Y updated, Z closed.

### Disconnecting

Settings page → "Disconnect" button. This removes stored credentials but keeps your synced positions.

## 7. Scan — Finding New Trades

URL: `/scan`

The scan runs a 7-stage pipeline against your entire ticker universe. Click **Run Full Scan** to trigger it.

### The 7 Stages

| Stage | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Universe** | Loads all active stocks grouped by sleeve |
| 2 | **Technical Filters** | Applies 6 technical filters to each ticker: Price > 200-MA, ADX ≥ 20, +DI > −DI, ATR% < 8% (7% for High-Risk), Efficiency ≥ 30%, Data Quality check |
| 3 | **Classification** | Tags each passing candidate: **READY** (≤ 2% from breakout), **WATCH** (≤ 3%), **FAR** (> 3%). Also flags **TRIGGERED** if price is at/above entry trigger. **COOLDOWN** blocks re-entry for tickers with a recent failed breakout. |
| 4 | **Ranking** | Scores candidates: Sleeve priority (Core 40, ETF 20, High-Risk 10, Hedge 5) + Status bonus (READY +30, WATCH +10) + ADX + Volume + Efficiency + Relative Strength |
| 5 | **Risk Gates** | Checks: Total open risk ≤ max, positions < max, sleeve within cap, cluster ≤ cap (20% default, 25% SMALL_ACCOUNT, 35% AGGRESSIVE), sector ≤ cap (25% default, 30% SMALL_ACCOUNT, 45% AGGRESSIVE), position size cap |
| 6 | **Anti-Chase Guard** | Monday gap guard: blocks if gapped > 0.75 ATR or > 3% above trigger. Also applies an **all-days** volatility extension check: extATR > 0.8 → WAIT_PULLBACK. Plus COOLDOWN block for failed breakouts. |
| 7 | **Position Sizing** | Calculates shares = floor((Equity × Risk%) / ((Entry − Stop) × FX)), fractional to 0.01 (T212). Skips if result ≤ 0 |

### Entry Trigger Formula

```
Entry Trigger = 20-day High + (buffer% × ATR(14))
```

The buffer % is **adaptive** (Module 11b): scales from **5% to 20%** based on ATR% and vol regime. Default centre is 10%.

### Stop Price (Initial)

```
Initial Stop = Entry Trigger − (1.5 × ATR(14))
```

### The Sidebar

- **Funnel visualisation:** Shows how many candidates survive each stage
- **Position Sizer calculator:** Standalone calculator to manually size a position given entry, stop, and equity

### Bottom Section

- **Ticker Chart:** Click any candidate row to see an interactive price chart with technical indicators

## 13. Hedge Portfolio — Long-Term Holds

### What Is the Hedge Sleeve?

The **HEDGE** sleeve is for stocks you want to hold long term — conviction positions that fall outside the normal swing-trading rules. They still receive full system guidance (stop recommendations, protection levels, P&L tracking) but are **exempt** from:

- **Open risk % calculation** — Hedge positions are excluded from the risk budget so they don't block new entries
- **Laggard purge** — No forced-exit flags, even if underwater for weeks
- **Position count limits** — Hedge positions don't count against your max positions
- **Sleeve cap** — Hedge has a 100% cap (effectively unlimited)

### Dashboard Card

The **Hedge Portfolio** card appears on the main dashboard and shows:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Total Value | Combined GBP value of all hedge positions |
| Total P&L | Aggregate profit/loss in £ and % |
| Position Count | Number of active hedge holdings |
| Per-Position Row | Ticker, current price, P&L %, R-multiple |
| Stop Guidance | Current protection level + recommended upgrade if available |
| Near-Stop Alert | Red highlight if price is within 5% of stop |
| Stop Upgrade Badge | Blue "↑ B/E" or "↑ Trail" badge when stop level can be raised |

### How to Add Hedge Positions

1. **Settings → Ticker Universe** — Add a stock with sleeve = **Hedge**
2. **Portfolio → Add Position** — Select **Hedge** from the sleeve dropdown
3. **Planning file** — Add tickers to `hedge.txt` and run `npx prisma db seed`

### Stop Guidance (Not Enforced)

Hedge positions still receive the full stop ladder recommendations:
- **Breakeven** at ≥ 1.5R → stop moves to entry
- **Partial Lock** at ≥ 2.5R → stop moves to entry + 0.5R
- **Trail + Lock** at ≥ 3.0R → stop = max(entry + 1R, close − 2×ATR)

These are shown as guidance badges on the dashboard card. You decide whether to act on them — the system won't auto-apply or flag for forced exit.

### API

`GET /api/positions/hedge?userId=default` — Returns all open hedge positions with live prices, P&L, and stop guidance.

---

## 17. Immutable Rules

These are hardcoded into the system and cannot be overridden:

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | **Stops NEVER go down** — monotonic enforcement throws error if attempted |
| 2 | **No entries without BULLISH regime** — scan gates block SIDEWAYS/BEARISH |
| 3 | **No entries without GREEN/YELLOW health** — pre-trade checklist enforces |
| 4 | **Risk per trade ≤ profile limit** — position sizer caps at profile % |
| 5 | **Total open risk ≤ profile cap** — risk gate rejects if exceeded |
| 6 | **Position sizing rounds DOWN** — fractional to 0.01 (T212), zero-size = skip |
| 7 | **No buying on Monday** — Observation phase, anti-chasing guard active |
| 8 | **Anti-chasing: gap > 0.75 ATR or > 3% blocks entry** — Monday guard |
| 9 | **Super-cluster cap at 50%** — concentration limit per super-cluster |
| 10 | **Heartbeat must be fresh** — data > 2 days = warn, > 5 days = fail |

## 18. Module System — 21 Risk & Analysis Checks

All modules run via `GET /api/modules?userId=X` and report to the Dashboard's Module Status Panel.

| # | Module | Status Meaning |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 2 | **Early Bird Entry** | 🟢 = candidates found during bullish regime, 🟡 = none found, 🔴 = wrong regime |
| 3 | **Laggard Purge** | 🟢 = no laggards, 🟡 = laggards flagged (held ≥ 10 days, down ≥ 2%), 🔴 = severe laggards |
| 5 | **Climax Top Exit** | 🟢 = no climax signals, 🟡 = tighten stops, 🔴 = trim recommended |
| 7 | **Heat-Map Swap** | 🟢 = no swaps, 🟡 = swap suggestions available |
| 8 | **Heat Check** | 🟢 = cluster OK, 🔴 = blocked (overweight cluster) |
| 9 | **Fast-Follower Re-Entry** | **DISABLED** — re-entry after stop-hit fights the tape at 4-position account size |
| 9.1 | **Regime Stability** | 🟢 = stable 3+ days, 🟡 = transitioning, 🔴 = chop detected |
| 10 | **Breadth Safety Valve** | 🟢 = breadth healthy (≥ 50%), 🟡 = below threshold, 🔴 = max positions restricted |
| 11 | **Whipsaw Kill Switch** | 🟢 = no blocks, 🔴 = ticker blocked (recent whipsaw) |
| 11b | **Adaptive ATR Buffer** | Internal — scales entry buffer 5%–20% based on ATR% and vol regime |
| 12 | **Super-Cluster Cap** | 🟢 = within 50% cap, 🔴 = breached |
| 13 | **Momentum Expansion** | **DISABLED** — procyclical risk expansion adds risk near end of moves, not middle |
| 14 | **Climax Trim/Tighten** | 🟢 = no action, 🟡 = tighten, 🔴 = trim |
| 15 | **Trades Log** | 🟢 = logged OK, includes slippage tracking |
| 16 | **Turnover Monitor** | 🟢 = healthy pace, 🟡 = high turnover (avg hold < 5d or > 20 trades/30d) |
| 17 | **Weekly Action Card** | Generated summary: candidates, stop updates, flags, budget |
| 18 | **Data Validation** | 🟢 = all data fresh, 🟡/🔴 = stale or anomalous tickers |
| 19 | **Dual Benchmark** | SPY + VWRL regime comparison, chop detection |
| 20 | **Re-Entry Logic** | Monitors closed positions for bullish re-entry after cooldown |
| 21 | **Position Tracking** | 🟢 = all positions valid, 🟡/🔴 = mismatches detected |
