Systematic trading workspace built around a Hybrid Turtle process: scan opportunities, enforce risk rules, plan weekly execution, and manage positions with disciplined stop logic.

## Why this project exists

HybridTurtle helps turn discretionary trading into a repeatable workflow:

- structured weekly cycle: Think → Observe → Act → Manage
- risk-first execution with hard safety constraints
- scan pipeline to rank and filter candidates
- portfolio visibility with stop protection progress
- optional Trading 212 sync and nightly automation

## Core capabilities

- **7-stage scan engine** for candidate discovery and qualification
- **Dual Score system** (BQS / FWS / NCS) for quantitative screening
- **Cross-Reference engine** to reconcile scan and dual score recommendations
- **Risk controls** (position sizing, open risk caps, concentration limits)
- **Portfolio management** with stop updates and R-multiple tracking
- **Plan workspace** for pre-trade checks and weekly execution
- **Dashboard command center** with health, regime, heartbeat, and modules
- **Automation hooks** for nightly checks and Telegram notifications

## Quick start (Windows)

### 1) Install (one-time)

1. Install **Node.js 20 or 22 LTS** — download from https://nodejs.org (choose the **LTS** tab).
2. Double-click **`install.bat`**.
3. Wait for it to finish — it installs dependencies, creates the database, generates secrets, and puts a shortcut on your Desktop.

That's it. The installer creates a `.env` file automatically with secure defaults. You don't need to edit any config files to get started.

> **Advanced:** If you want to customise settings (e.g. Telegram alerts, alternative data provider), see [Environment variables](#environment-variables) below or edit `.env` manually. You can also copy `.env.example` to `.env` **before** running the installer to start from a template instead.

### 2) Launch (daily)

- Double-click the **"HybridTurtle Dashboard"** shortcut on your Desktop.
- Or double-click `start.bat` in the project folder.
- Your browser opens automatically to http://localhost:3000/dashboard.
- **Keep the black terminal window open** while using the dashboard — closing it stops the server.

### Launcher files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `install.bat` | First-time setup (deps, database, desktop shortcut) |
| `start.bat` | Primary daily launcher |
| `run-dashboard.bat` | Compatibility alias (redirects to `start.bat`) |
| `nightly.bat` | Compatibility alias (redirects to `nightly-task.bat`) |
| `seed-tickers.bat` | Re-seed ticker universe from Planning files |
| `update.bat` | Update dependencies/database after pulling new code |
| `nightly-task.bat` | Run nightly automation checks (schedulable via Task Scheduler) |
| `package-for-distribution.bat` | Package the app for offline distribution |

## Environment variables

The installer creates `.env` automatically with working defaults. You only need this section if you want to customise behaviour.

To start from the template instead, copy `.env.example` to `.env` before running `install.bat`. Required variables are marked with **★** (all are auto-generated by the installer).

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ★ | `file:./dev.db` | SQLite database path — no external DB needed |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | ★ | — | Random secret for session signing (change in production) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | ★ | — | Secret protecting the `/api/nightly` endpoint |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | | `http://localhost:3000` | Base URL for NextAuth callbacks |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | | — | Telegram bot token for nightly alerts (see below) |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | | — | Telegram chat ID for alert delivery |
| `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER` | | `yahoo` | Market data source — `yahoo` (default) or `eodhd` |
| `EODHD_API_KEY` | | — | EODHD API key (required only when `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER=eodhd`) |
| `NIGHTLY_CRON` | | `30 21 * * *` | Cron expression for nightly run (default 9:30 PM UK) |

## Telegram notifications (optional)

The nightly automation can send alerts covering stop changes, laggard warnings, climax-top signals, swap suggestions, whipsaw blocks, breadth safety, momentum expansion, and ready-to-buy candidates.

### Setup

1. Create a bot with **@BotFather** on Telegram (`/newbot`) and copy the token.
2. Send at least one message to your new bot.
3. Get your chat ID by visiting `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`.
4. Add both values to `.env`:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-token"
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your-chat-id"
   ```
5. Restart with `start.bat`.
6. Test from **Settings → Telegram Notifications → Send Test Message** in the dashboard.
7. To automate nightly delivery, run `install.bat` and choose **Y** for the nightly Task Scheduler entry.

## Performance notes

The dashboard relies on `/api/modules` which runs 21 module checks including several Yahoo Finance calls. To keep load times low:

- **Parallelised external calls** — breadth calculation, climax scan, dual-regime detection, fast-follower scan, re-entry scan, SPY ADX, and pyramid ATR fetches all run concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`.
- **Shared data** — SPY historical bars are fetched once and reused for both ADX and dual-regime calculations.
- **Server-side response cache** — the `/api/modules` result is cached for 5 minutes so repeat visits within a session don't re-run everything.
- **Client-side TTL** — the Zustand store marks module data stale after 10 minutes; the `useModulesData` hook prevents concurrent duplicate fetches.
- **Yahoo Finance caching** — quote data is cached for 30 minutes, historical bars for 24 hours, and FX rates for 30 minutes (all in-process memory).
- **No auto-polling** — data is fetched once when the dashboard loads. Manual refresh buttons on the market bar and hedge card let you pull fresh data on demand. This suits an infrequent-use pattern (checking once or twice a day).

On first server start with an empty cache, background pre-caching fetches historical bars for all active tickers so the first dashboard load doesn't trigger hundreds of sequential chart calls.

## Troubleshooting

### "Node.js not found"
Download and install from https://nodejs.org (choose the **LTS** version). Close and re-open the terminal, then try again.

### "npm install failed"
- Run `install.bat` as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator).
- Temporarily disable antivirus software.
- Ensure you have internet access.

### "Prisma engines do not seem to be compatible" / "not a valid Win32 application"
This means the Prisma database engine doesn't match your Node.js architecture. Usually caused by having 32-bit Node.js on a 64-bit machine.
1. Check your architecture: open a terminal and run `node -e "console.log(process.arch)"`
2. If it says `ia32` instead of `x64` — uninstall Node.js, then download and install the **64-bit (x64)** version from https://nodejs.org
3. Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `install.bat` again

If the architecture is already `x64`, the binary may be corrupted (e.g. antivirus quarantine). Delete `node_modules\.prisma`, then run `npx prisma generate`.

### "Port 3000 already in use"
`start.bat` handles this automatically. If it persists, open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), end any **Node.js** processes, and try again.

### Dashboard shows no data
Go to the **Scan** page, click **Run Full Scan** to fetch live data from Yahoo Finance. The first scan may take 2–3 minutes for all tickers.

### Need to reset the database
Delete `prisma/dev.db` and run `install.bat` again.
