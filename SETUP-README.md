2. Send at least one message to the bot.
3. Get your chat ID from:
   - `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`
4. In the app, open **Settings → Telegram Notifications** and test with **Send Test Message**.
5. Put these values in `.env`:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="..."`
   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="..."`
6. Restart with `start.bat`.
7. To automate nightly delivery, run `install.bat` and choose **Y** for the nightly Telegram task.

## Troubleshooting

### "Node.js not found"
Download and install from https://nodejs.org (choose the LTS version).
After installing, close and re-open the terminal, then try again.

### "npm install failed"
- Try running `install.bat` as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)
- Temporarily disable antivirus software
- Make sure you have internet access

### "Port 3000 already in use"
The `start.bat` script handles this automatically. If it persists:
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Find any "Node.js" processes
3. End them
4. Try `start.bat` again

### Dashboard shows no data
1. Go to the **Scan** page
2. Click **Run Full Scan** — this fetches live data from Yahoo Finance
3. The first scan may take 2-3 minutes for all 268 tickers

### Need to reset the database
Delete the file `prisma/dev.db` and run `install.bat` again.
